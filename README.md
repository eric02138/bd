# bd robot events
A demonstration of how to create tools that allow users to
- easily find robot event data 
- export the data for use with existing internal BD software tools
- share their data across the organization

We also talked about how to automate work in the future.  For example, rather than save the data locally, it would be great to send the data produced along to another API or script that mimicked the existing BD software.
