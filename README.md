# bd
A demonstration of tracking robots.

Nate and I talked about a couple of things in our initial interview.  How to create tools that enable testers to
- easily find robot data in a web UI
- export the data for use with existing internal BD software tools
- allow users to share their data across the organization using APIs
- allow users to see only "their" robots ("I don't care about all robots, just these ones here")

We also talked about how to automate work in the future.  For example, rather than save the data locally, it would be great to send the data produced along to another API or script that mimicked the existing BD software.
